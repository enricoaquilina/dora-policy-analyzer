# DORA Compliance System - Security Framework

This directory contains the security infrastructure and policies for the DORA Compliance System, implementing a comprehensive zero-trust security model.

## Security Architecture Overview

The DORA compliance system implements a multi-layered security framework designed to meet regulatory requirements and protect sensitive financial data:

### Zero-Trust Security Model
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every request is authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal access rights for users and services
- **Assume Breach**: Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- **Continuous Verification**: Real-time monitoring and adaptive controls

### Security Principles
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple overlapping security controls
2. **Security by Design**: Security built into every component
3. **Compliance First**: Regulatory requirements drive security design
4. **Automation**: Automated security controls and response
5. **Visibility**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Security Components

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0/OIDC with multi-factor authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- **Identity Providers**: Integration with enterprise SSO systems
- **Service Identity**: Workload identity for service-to-service authentication

### 2. Secrets Management
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Centralized secrets storage and management
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Short-lived, automatically rotated credentials
- **Secret Injection**: Secure delivery of secrets to applications
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit log of secret access

### 3. Network Security
- **Zero-Trust Network**: Micro-segmentation with network policies
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for encrypted service-to-service communication
- **Ingress Security**: WAF and DDoS protection at the edge
- **Private Networks**: Isolated VPC with private subnets

### 4. Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Automated key rotation and lifecycle management
- **Data Classification**: Automatic classification and protection

### 5. Security Monitoring
- **SIEM Integration**: Security Information and Event Management
- **Behavioral Analytics**: AI-powered anomaly detection

# DORA Compliance System - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive architecture documentation for the DORA Compliance Multi-Agent System. The architecture is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and resilient platform for automated DORA compliance management.

## Document Structure

### Core Documentation

1. **[System Architecture Design](./system-architecture-design.md)**
   - Complete architectural blueprint
   - Technology stack decisions
   - Component specifications
   - Integration patterns
   - Security architecture
   - Deployment strategies

### Architecture Diagrams

The `diagrams/` directory contains visual representations of the system architecture:

- **High-Level Architecture**: Overall system structure and component relationships
- **Agent Architecture**: Detailed view of individual agent components
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
- **Security Architecture**: Security layers and controls
- **Deployment Architecture**: Infrastructure and deployment topology

To generate the diagrams:
```bash
cd diagrams
pip install diagrams
python component-diagram.py
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture
We've chosen a multi-agent architecture where each agent specializes in a specific DORA compliance domain:
- Policy Analyzer Agent
- Gap Assessment Agent
- Risk Calculator Agent
- Implementation Planner Agent
- ICT Risk Management Agent
- Incident Management Agent
- Digital Resilience Testing Agent
- Third-Party Risk Agent
- Threat Intelligence Agent

### 2. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python (AI/ML), Go (high-performance services), Node.js (utilities)
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Next.js
- **Databases**: Neo4j (graph), PostgreSQL (relational), MongoDB (documents), InfluxDB (time-series)
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio
- **Security**: HashiCorp Vault, mTLS, Zero-Trust Architecture

### 3. Cloud-Native Design
- Containerized microservices
- Kubernetes-based orchestration
- Horizontal auto-scaling
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- GitOps deployment (ArgoCD)

## Architecture Principles

1. **Microservices & Domain-Driven Design**
   - Each agent as a bounded context
   - Clear service boundaries
   - Independent deployment

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Asynchronous communication
   - Event sourcing for audit trails
   - CQRS for optimization

3. **Security by Design**
   - Zero-trust network
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Principle of least privilege

4. **Resilience & Fault Tolerance**
   - Circuit breakers
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Graceful degradation

5. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Load balancing
   - Caching strategies

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Docker 24+
- Kubernetes 1.28+
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- Terraform 1.6+

### Environment Setup
1. Review the architecture documentation
2. Set up development environment following the infrastructure guide
3. Deploy core infrastructure components
4. Implement agents according to specifications

## Architecture Review Process

1. **Design Reviews**: All architectural changes must be reviewed
2. **Decision Log**: Document all architectural decisions
3. **Diagram Updates**: Keep diagrams synchronized with implementation
4. **Security Reviews**: Regular security architecture assessments

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated whenever:
- New components are added
- Technology decisions change
- Architecture patterns evolve
- Security requirements update
